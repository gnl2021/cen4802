        <p>Hello, I'm Gregory Lauture. Fresh from finishing my Associate degree in Computer Programming and Analysis at Valencia College, I've decided to double the pain, and I'm now on track to become a software developer. I'm not good at socializing. My main hobbies are reading the Bible (a lot!), reading comic books, or listening to classical music to relax. I've learned C, C++, and Java but still need real-world experience for better programming habits.</p><br>
